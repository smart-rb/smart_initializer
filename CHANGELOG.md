# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New options for option and param attributes:
  - Support for attribute **aliasing** (`:as` parameter);
    - supports: `option`, `param`;
  - Support for attribute **auto-casting** (`:auto_cast` parameter);
    - supports: `option`, `param`;
  - Support for **mutable** attributes (`:mutable` parameter) with type-validation inside;
    - supports: `option`, `options`, `param`, `params`;
  - Support for **optional** attributes (`:optional` parameter);
    - supports: `option`;
- **SmartCore::Initializer::Configuration**:
  - Configuration setting `strict_options` now works separately "per-class" in all configs manner
    (each class shares the global state but has own state too)
  - Support for per-class/global `:auto_cast` configuration;
    - provides a global/per-class behavior for `:cast` option (`false` by default);
- `options` declaration now supports `privacy` option;
- `params` declaration now supports `privacy` option;

### Changed
- Drop support of **Ruby@2.4**;
- `:default` attribute parameter now duplicates the passed value during object instantiation;
- `:default` attribute parameter only works with `option` attribute (`param` can't have `default` parameter now);
- Attribute values generated by `:finalize` are type-validated now too;
- Now lambda-based `:finalize` attributes are being checked for the signature during attribute declaration;
- Some error messages have become more readable;

## Fixed
- `send` method overlaping/rewriting: otions and params named as `send` breaks the internal
  framework-related invocations of the attribute definitioning inside the custom object constructor
  (this name rewrites internal Ruby's `send` method and brokes some things);
